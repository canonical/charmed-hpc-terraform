# Terragrunt examples on LXD

Each subdirectory deploys a workload on the local LXD cloud in two Terragrunt
units:

1. **`<plan>/controller/`**: bootstraps a Juju controller on LXD.
2. **`<plan>/` (root)**: deploys the workload on that controller. It reads the
   controller's connection details from the `controller` unit's outputs via a
   Terragrunt `dependency` block.

Available plans:

* **`lustre/`**: a Lustre filesystem mounted on an `ubuntu` machine. The plan
  disables Secure Boot on the LXD profile Juju generates for the model (see
  `examples/lustre/lxd/README.md` for the underlying OpenTofu plan).
* **`slurm/`**: a Slurm cluster (MySQL, `slurmctld`, `slurmdbd`, `slurmrestd`,
  `sackd`, and two compute partitions). See `modules/slurm`.

Run a plan from its directory:

```shell
cd lustre   # or slurm
terragrunt run --all apply
```

## Prerequisites

* [Terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/) and
  [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) installed.
* The Juju CLI installed.
* LXD installed on the system, with certificate credentials registered
  with the Juju CLI (i.e. you have run `juju add-credential localhost`).

## LXD credentials

The `controller` units take their LXD certificate credentials from the
`LXD_CLIENT_CERT`, `LXD_CLIENT_KEY`, and `LXD_SERVER_CERT` environment
variables when set. Otherwise they fall back to the `localhost` credential
registered with the local Juju client, read directly from
`~/.local/share/juju/credentials.yaml`.

## Accessing the controller with the Juju CLI

The controller unit writes a minimal `controllers.yaml` to
`.terraform/juju-data/controllers.yaml` and outputs a ready-to-use setup
command. After `terragrunt run --all apply` completes, get interactive CLI
access to the controller with:

```shell
cd examples/terragrunt/lxd/lustre/controller   # or lxd/slurm/controller

# Fetch the admin password (only required once)
terragrunt output -json connection | jq -r .password

# Set up a temporary JUJU_DATA and log in (use -raw to avoid JSON escaping)
eval "$(terragrunt output -raw juju_cli_setup_command)"

# Verify access
juju status
juju debug-log
```

The `JUJU_DATA` points at a temporary directory containing only the
controller's `controllers.yaml`, so your persistent `~/.local/share/juju`
config is untouched.

## Tearing down

From the plan's directory:

```shell
terragrunt run --all destroy
```

The dependency graph destroys the workload deployment first, then the
controller.
